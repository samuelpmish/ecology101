# Week 3: Animals

This week, we care about animals...

Here's some r code you can use to calculate how much we care about animals:

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Use stdout as per normal...
print("Hello, world!")

# Use plots...
plot(cars)

# Even ggplot!
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, colour = factor(cyl))
```
